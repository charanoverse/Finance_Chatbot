Financial goals are targets individuals set for saving and investing. They can be classified as:
- Short-term (1–3 years): Vacation, emergency fund, buying a gadget.
- Medium-term (3–7 years): Home down payment, higher education.
- Long-term (7+ years): Retirement, wealth creation.

Each goal requires a different investment strategy. Short-term goals should use safe, liquid options, while long-term goals can use equities for higher growth. Aligning investments with goals prevents ad-hoc decisions.
