Taxes are mandatory contributions to the government. For individuals, income tax is levied on salary, business, or other income. 

Basic tax-saving instruments include:
- Section 80C: Investments like ELSS mutual funds, PPF, and life insurance premiums (limit â‚¹1.5 lakh).
- Section 80D: Health insurance premiums.
- NPS: Deductions under Section 80CCD.

Investors should choose tax-saving options that align with their risk profile and goals rather than investing only for tax purposes.
