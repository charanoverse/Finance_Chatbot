Equity represents ownership in a company. Investors who buy shares are partial owners and can benefit from dividends and price appreciation. Equity is considered high risk because stock prices fluctuate based on company performance, market sentiment, and economic factors.

Over long periods, equity tends to outperform other asset classes, but in the short term, it can be volatile. Equity is suitable for long-term wealth creation, but investors should diversify across sectors and avoid speculative trading.
