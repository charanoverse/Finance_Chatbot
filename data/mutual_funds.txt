A mutual fund pools money from multiple investors and invests it in stocks, bonds, or other securities. They are professionally managed and allow diversification with small amounts of capital. 

Types of mutual funds include:
- Equity funds: Higher risk, higher potential returns, suitable for long-term goals.
- Debt funds: Lower risk, stable returns, suitable for short-term goals.
- Hybrid funds: Mix of equity and debt for balanced investors.

Mutual funds charge an expense ratio for management. Investors should match the type of fund with their risk profile and goals.
