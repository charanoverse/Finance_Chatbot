Retirement planning involves building a corpus to cover expenses after active income stops. Key steps include estimating future expenses, accounting for inflation, and investing regularly.

Common instruments:
- EPF and PPF: Safe, government-backed, long-term.
- NPS: Market-linked pension scheme with tax benefits.
- Equity Mutual Funds: For long-term growth potential.
- Annuities: Provide post-retirement regular income.

Starting early allows the power of compounding to build a larger retirement fund with smaller contributions.
