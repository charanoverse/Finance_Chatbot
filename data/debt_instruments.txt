Debt instruments are investments where investors lend money to an entity (government, company, bank) in return for interest payments. Examples include bonds, debentures, and debt mutual funds.

Debt provides predictable returns with lower risk than equity, but inflation may reduce real returns. Credit risk (borrower default) and interest rate risk (value falling when rates rise) must be considered. 

Debt is suitable for conservative investors and for balancing equity-heavy portfolios.
