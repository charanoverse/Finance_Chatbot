Investment risk refers to the possibility of losing some or all of the invested capital. Risks can be categorized as:

- Low Risk: Bank deposits, government bonds. Provide steady but low returns.
- Medium Risk: Debt mutual funds, balanced funds. Offer moderate stability and returns.
- High Risk: Equity, cryptocurrencies, derivatives. Can deliver high growth but with high volatility.

Investors should match risk levels with their financial goals, age, and income stability. Risk tolerance generally decreases with age or near-term financial needs.
