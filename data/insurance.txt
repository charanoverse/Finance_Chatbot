Insurance protects against financial losses due to unforeseen events. The most important type for individuals is term life insurance, which offers high coverage at a low premium but pays out only in case of death.

Other types include:
- Health insurance: Covers hospitalization expenses.
- ULIPs: Insurance + investment but with higher costs.
- General insurance: Covers assets like vehicles or property.

Term insurance is recommended as the foundation, while ULIPs should be approached cautiously due to charges.
