An emergency fund is money set aside to cover unexpected expenses such as medical bills, car repairs, or job loss. Financial planners recommend keeping 3–6 months’ worth of living expenses in a liquid form such as a savings account, FD, or liquid mutual fund.

The goal of an emergency fund is financial security, ensuring that sudden costs do not force investors to liquidate long-term assets or take loans. This fund should be accessible, low risk, and not tied to volatile investments like equities.

Building an emergency fund should be the first financial step before investing for long-term goals.
