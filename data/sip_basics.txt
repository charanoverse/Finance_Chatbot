Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) is a method of investing a fixed sum regularly in a mutual fund scheme. By investing monthly or quarterly, investors can average out the cost of purchase and benefit from compounding. SIPs promote financial discipline and are ideal for long-term wealth creation, especially for salaried individuals.

SIPs are linked to market performance, so returns are not guaranteed. However, they help reduce the effect of short-term volatility. SIPs can be tailored to suit different risk levels by choosing equity, debt, or hybrid mutual funds. They are especially recommended for young investors who can stay invested for 5â€“10 years or longer.
