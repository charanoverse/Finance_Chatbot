Budgeting is the process of planning income and expenses to ensure financial discipline. A popular approach is the 50-30-20 rule:
- 50% of income: Needs (housing, food, bills).
- 30% of income: Wants (entertainment, lifestyle).
- 20% of income: Savings and investments.

Budgeting helps avoid overspending, reduce debt, and achieve long-term goals. Beginners can start by tracking daily expenses for a few months to identify patterns. Apps and digital tools can make this easier.

A budget should be flexible but consistent, reviewed monthly, and aligned with financial priorities.
